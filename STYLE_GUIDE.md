# BaseCRM Design System

Inspired by the Base.org aesthetic ("Swiss Style met Tech").

## 1. Philosophy
*   **Bold & Minimal:** Use high contrast. Do not hide complexity, organize it.
*   **Solid Colors:** Avoid gradients. Use solid blocks of vibrant color (Blue, Yellow, Green) against strict monochrome.
*   **Typography:** Functional and robust. `Inter` for interface, `JetBrains Mono` for data/code.
*   **Shapes:** Sharp edges or minimal rounding (2px-4px). No "pill" shapes unless strictly for tags.

## 2. Color Palette
Primary Brand Colors:
*   **Blue (Hero):** `#0000FF` (Strict primary action color)
*   **Black (Strong):** `#000000` (Headings, Primary Buttons)
*   **White (Canvas):** `#FFFFFF`

Secondary (Bursts of Energy):
*   **Yellow:** `#FFD12F` (Highlights, Notifications)
*   **Green:** `#66C800` (Success, Growth)
*   **Pink:** `#FEA8CD` (Creative, Accents)
*   **Red:** `#FC401F` (Errors, Alerts)

Grayscale:
*   Use the full spectrum from `#EEF0F3` (Backgrounds) to `#0A0B0D` (Text).

## 3. Interaction
*   **Hover States:** Sharp transitions. `bg-blue-600` -> `bg-blue-700`.
*   **Feedback:** Use the "Terminal" aesthetic for system status.
*   **Data Vis:** Pixelated or block-based visualizations rather than smooth splines.

## 4. Localization
*   Target: Japanese market with English technical terms kept for "Cool factor" (e.g., "Auto Generate", "Enrich").
